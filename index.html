<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

<p>
Stride Orthotic Lab ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy and is committed
to protecting personal and clinical information. This Privacy Policy explains
how data is collected, used, stored, and protected when using the Stride Orthotic
Lab mobile application ("the App").
</p>

<h2>1. Intended Use</h2>
<p>
The App is an internal clinical tool intended for use by licensed clinicians,
pedorthists, orthotists, and partner clinics for the purpose of capturing foot
scan data and submitting custom orthotic orders.
</p>
<p>
The App is not a consumer-facing application and is not intended for use by
patients directly.
</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>The App may collect the following data when used by authorized users:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Foot scan data (3D point clouds or mesh files such as PLY)</li>
  <li>Order-related clinical information entered by the clinician</li>
  <li>Clinic or practitioner identification details</li>
  <li>Technical metadata required to operate the App securely</li>
</ul>

<p>
The App does <strong>not</strong> collect advertising data, behavioral tracking
data, or analytics for marketing purposes.
</p>

<h2>3. How Data Is Used</h2>
<p>Collected data is used solely to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Generate and manufacture custom orthotic devices</li>
  <li>Manage clinical orders and drafts</li>
  <li>Enable secure storage and retrieval of scan files</li>
  <li>Maintain the integrity and functionality of the App</li>
</ul>

<p>
Data is not sold, shared for advertising, or used for profiling.
</p>

<h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p>
Data is stored securely using industry-standard cloud infrastructure. Access is
restricted to authorized users and systems involved in order fulfillment.
</p>
<p>
We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data against
unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or disclosure.
</p>

<h2>5. Authentication</h2>
<p>
Access to the App requires authenticated credentials. User sessions are managed
securely to ensure only authorized clinicians can access stored data.
</p>

<h2>6. Camera and Sensor Usage</h2>
<p>
The App uses the device’s front-facing camera and TrueDepth sensor exclusively
for capturing 3D foot scans required for clinical orthotic design.
</p>
<p>
Camera data is used only during active scanning sessions and is not recorded,
streamed, or stored outside of the scan files explicitly saved by the clinician.
</p>

<h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
<p>
Clinical data and scan files are retained only as long as necessary to fulfill
their intended clinical and operational purposes or as required by applicable
regulations.
</p>

<h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
The App may rely on secure third-party services for authentication, data storage,
and infrastructure support. These services are used solely to enable App
functionality and are not permitted to use data for their own purposes.
</p>

<h2>9. Your Responsibilities</h2>
<p>
Clinics and clinicians using the App are responsible for ensuring that patient
data is collected and used in compliance with applicable healthcare and privacy
regulations in their jurisdiction.
</p>

<h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any updates will be posted
on this page with a revised effective date.
</p>
